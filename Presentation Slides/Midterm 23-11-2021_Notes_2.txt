Slide 6:
Vortragender Wechselt:
In many booleanfunctions the error can be interpreted with the help of the Hamming distance. This was also possible for the one bit addition presented on the previous slide. 
But when we calculate the addition of two multibit numbers the output must also be interpreted as number.


Slide 7:
So the Hamming distance is no of interest. The errer between the exact solution and the approximated solution is the difference. To analyze it we must subtract the two numbers.


Slide 8:
As the system grows exponentially  truth table analysis is not recommended anymore.
As solution to this we use a Binary Decision Diagram or short BDD. A BDD is an graph to represent the Boolean function.

It consists of nodes, each representing one input Bit, and edges. An edge represents the the value of the input. As demonstration we want to present this small example.
We start with X[0]. There are two edges, one for when x[0] = 0 and for x[0] = 1. The edges go to the next Input x[1]. If both x[0] and x[1] are 0 then the solution is 0, so the edge goes directly to the 0. 
This reduction of possible paths lead to a much smaller representation then a truth table .

It is possible to compute and analyze BDD automatically and the complexity only grows either linear or quadratic
 with the amount of inputs, depending of the operatione on the BDD.(Exact numbers in “An Introduction to BDDs” by Henrik Reif Andersen)
